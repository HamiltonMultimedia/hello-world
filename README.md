# My hello-world readme file.

Hello World,

Welcome to my "readme file". 

This is where I record ideas, resources, share and discuss things, kinda like a journal.

In IT terms you could view this as documentation about me, by me. 

I'm a Systems Architech, Syytems Administrator, Software Engineer and Developer.

I work with many languages right now I mostly write Python code.

For projects I use Django, Kivy, React.js, React-Native, Node.js, & Flutter frameworks.

For servers I've used Apache, Nginx, Express.js, and Node.js core module.

For databases I've used MongoDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MSSQL, PostgreSQL and Couchbase.  

As technology is constantly evolving at a very rapid pace, 
to adapt I must also dedicate myself to learning constantly.

Lately I've been researching the changes and updates to Python and React.

Now I'm putting a stronger focus on security features in applications.

One attractive security feature I've seen is End-to-End encryption. 

This requires 2 keys, one public and one private. One end creates, encrypts and sends the message while the other receives and decrypts it. This maintains that the message is encryted from End-toEnd. 

In addition to encryption I've also been looking into monitoring options and I've found a tutorial which explains how to write a Python port scanning script that reports which ports are open on your computer.

Open ports can be used as entry points to access your computer and then perform malicious actions. 

The port scanner is meant for users to dicover which ports are open and close them as needed before an attacker exploits them. 

On the other hand an attacker can use a port scanner to discover which ports are open on your machine and deliver a malicious payload which has potential to perform devastating attacks to your computer.

These days data is a hot commodity so I'm learning how to harness and secure data in applications. 

I am also learning networking and how to connect applications over Wide Area Networks

This is how most applications function is the modern computing environment.

Now I'm using a combination of various technologies including Docker and Kubernetes to build a new application which includes networking orchestration. 

This also allows for automation of the processes invoving packaging, updating and patching of application components.

On the topic of orchestration microservices has become a popular concept in the world of app development. 

Prior to this we have what's known as monolithic or legacy app architecture concepts where all the components of the app are housed on the same server all struggling to use the same system's resources at the same time. 
you could imagin how slow that app would become at scale. 
So now we have the microservices all distributed on different computers in various locations operating on a Wide Area Network connection that makes it all possible.

I've discovered that I have the desire to learn and understand the whole System Architecture of apps. I've decided to find a career path to that of a Solutions Architect.

In the effort of prviding the best security I can offer in my applications I am planning several learning initiatives that will provide the knowledge necessary for me to create security measures beyond what is "off-the-shelf". I will learn C programming and how it relates to today's programming languages in order to go to a deep level of security implementation. Also I will learn the skills of hacking in order to learn how to defend against offensive hackers.

For my application development purposes I am learning how to construct Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.

I'm also taking some time out to learn Java development deeper and build comprehensive apps with it. Learning Java better with give me access to using Apache Spark which has Machine Learning algorithms built-in. 

I've discovered that MongoDB offers an Apache Spark connector.
