# My hello-world readme file.

Hello World,

I'm a Systems Architech, Syytems Administrator, Software Engineer and Developer.

I work with many languages right now I mostly write Python code.

For projects I use Django, Kivy, React.js, React-Native, Node.js, & Flutter frameworks.

For servers I've used Apache, Nginx, Express.js, and Node.js core module.

For databases I've used MongoDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MSSQL, PostgreSQL and Couchbase. 

Here is where I record ideas, resources, share and discuss things. 

As technology is constantly evolving at a very rapid pace, 
to adapt I must also dedicate myself to learning constantly.

Lately I've been researching the changes and updates to Python and React.

Now I'm putting a stronger focus on security features in applications.

One attractive security feature I've seen is End-to-End encryption. 

This requires 2 keys, one public and one private. One end creates, encrypts and sends the message while the other receives and decrypts it. This maintains that the message is encryted from End-toEnd. 

In addition to encryption I've also been looking into monitoring options and I've found a tutorial which explains how to write a Python port scanning script that reports which ports are open on your system.
