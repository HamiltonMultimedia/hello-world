# My hello-world readme file.

Hello World,

Welcome to my "readme file". 

This is where I record ideas, resources, share and discuss things, kinda like a journal.

In IT terms you could view this as documentation about me, by me. 

I'm a Systems Architech, Syytems Administrator, Software Engineer and Developer.

I work with many languages right now I mostly write Python code.

For projects I use Django, Kivy, React.js, React-Native, Node.js, & Flutter frameworks.

For servers I've used Apache, Nginx, Express.js, and Node.js core module.

For databases I've used MongoDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MSSQL, PostgreSQL and Couchbase.  

As technology is constantly evolving at a very rapid pace, 
to adapt I must also dedicate myself to learning constantly.

Lately I've been researching the changes and updates to Python and React.

Now I'm putting a stronger focus on security features in applications.

One attractive security feature I've seen is End-to-End encryption. 

This requires 2 keys, one public and one private. One end creates, encrypts and sends the message while the other receives and decrypts it. This maintains that the message is encrypted from End-to-End. 

In addition to encryption I've also been looking into monitoring options and I've found a tutorial which explains how to write a Python port scanning script that reports which ports are open on your computer.

Open ports can be used as entry points to access your computer and then perform malicious actions. 

The port scanner is meant for users to discover which ports are open and close them as needed before an attacker exploits them. 

On the other hand an attacker can use a port scanner to discover which ports are open on your machine and deliver a malicious payload which has potential to perform devastating attacks to your computer.

Think of ports like the doors and windows of your home. If an attacker finds your address then they have to find a way inside your home. If you leave your doors or windows open or unlocked this makes it easy for an intruder to find their way in.  
It's a similar concept with computers and that is what we know as bad "Hacking". There is a concept of good "Hacking" too where you "hack" at a patricular problem to find a solution that works, meaning you try different methods until you find one (or more) that works. This is a special skill that can be used for good or bad "Hacking".

These days data is a hot commodity so I'm learning how to harness and secure data in applications. 

I am also learning networking and how to connect applications over Wide Area Networks

This is how most applications function is the modern computing environment.

Now I'm using a combination of various technologies including Docker and Kubernetes to build a new application which includes networking orchestration. 

This also allows for automation of the processes invoving packaging, updating and patching of application components.

On the topic of orchestration microservices has become a popular concept in the world of app development. 

Prior to this we have what's known as monolithic or legacy app architecture concepts where all the components of the app are housed on the same server all struggling to use the same system's resources at the same time. 
You could imagin how slow that app would become at scale. 
So now we have the microservices & cloud architectures all distributed on different computers in various locations operating on a Wide Area Network (possibly private) connection that makes it all possible.

I've discovered that I have the desire to learn and understand the whole System Architecture of apps. I've decided to find a career path to that of a Solutions Architect.

In the effort of prviding the best security I can offer in my applications I am planning several learning initiatives that will provide the knowledge necessary for me to create security measures beyond what is "off-the-shelf". I will learn C programming and how it relates to today's programming languages in order to go to a deep level of security implementation. Also I will learn the skills of hacking in order to learn how to defend against offensive hackers.

For my application development purposes I am learning how to construct Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.

I'm also taking some time out to learn Java development deeper and build comprehensive apps with it. Learning Java better with give me access to using Apache Spark which has Machine Learning algorithms built-in. 

I've discovered that MongoDB offers an Apache Spark connector. Using this connector I plan to provide ML features to many React & React-Native applications. 
I'm feeling like I'll need microservices for this to work efficiently, we shall see.

Today I've discovered the various methods of handling input in Python classes using 
bound, unbound and static methods. This discovery helped me to see the benefits of each and how to use them together to make interactive applications.

Bound methods isolate data from the rest of the application. This mitigates confusion going forward and allows it to process data efficiently.

So I've decided to dig deeper and go beyond the app designer and basic developer skills and take on an even more responsible task which is learning cloud architectures for apps with data algorithms in HPCs.

Thus far it's been interesting and fun to apply machine learning algorithms to distributed computing applications. Finding the connectors and connecting them with different frameworks has proved a bit challenging. Yet it's really exciting when it all finally works.

Brushing up on my Networking Fundamentals again. It's amazing to see how tech has changed over the years. Re-visiting the OSI model and all it's layers. This action may help me discover new or unusual ways of connecting components of the model.

As a Software Development Engineer I've decided to dig a lot deeper this time and really get to understand Networking on a much deeper level. I'm aware of how processes and protocols operate on the seven levels of the OSI model but knowing how the encapsulation methods interact with each other will allow me to make deeper optimizations and implement tighter security methods in my future applications. 

By focusing on the protocols available I can apply tighter security measures on my apps.
