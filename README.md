# My hello-world readme file.

Hello World,

I'm a Systems Architech, Syytems Administrator, Software Engineer and Developer.

I work with many languages right now I mostly write Python code.

For projects I use Django, Kivy, React.js, React-Native, Node.js, & Flutter frameworks.

For servers I've used Apache, Nginx, Express.js, and Node.js core module.

For databases I've used MongoDB, MySQL/MariaDB, MSSQL, PostgreSQL and Couchbase. 

Here is where I record ideas, resources, share and discuss things. 

As technology is constantly evolving at a very rapid pace, 
to adapt I must also dedicate myself to learning constantly.

Lately I've been researching the changes and updates to Python and React.
